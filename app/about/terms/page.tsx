        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><i>Effective date: June 16, 2020</i></p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;, &quot;Terms of Service&quot;) carefully before using the <a href="https://chartinsight.com">https://chartinsight.com</a> website (the &quot;Service&quot;) operated by ChartInsight LLC. (&quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;).</p>

        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

        <p>All content on this web site, including information sent via electronic notifications, are the sole property of ChartInsight LLC. As such, they are intended solely for use by designated recipients, and are protected from sharing or copying by US and international copyright law. No reproduction, retransmission, or other use of the information or images is authorized.</p>

        <p>Use of automated scripting tools to crawl the site is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of your subscription. Excessive requests may result in throttling of your account&apos;s access to data.</p>

        <h2>Limited Warranties Disclaimer</h2>

        <p>ChartInsight collects SEC filing data (10-Q, 10-K, 13F, 13D/G) through an automated process with little to no human intervention. Without human oversight, there is a greater risk that data error may exist since we are relying on the filer to provide accurate information in the correct format. Use at your own risk.</p>

        <p><b>User acknowledges and agrees that no warranty is given that the information is error-free or accurate.</b> The Service is provided without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of performance, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, omissions, completeness, correctness and delays. User expressly assumes all risks from using the information on ChartInsight.com or sent by ChartInsight via notifications.</p>

        <p>At any time the Service is likely to contain inaccuracies or omissions. As with any software, our Service will inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones. ChartInsight shall not be liable for any loss, direct or consequential damages or expenses relating to the accuracy and completeness of the data provided. This data has been compiled for informational purposes only and not as investment advice. You should not rely upon this data or information when making an investment decision. You should independently verify all relevant information prior to making an investment decision. Past performance is not an indication of future results.</p>

        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL CHARTINSIGHT LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY INVESTMENT LOSS YOU MAY INCUR. INVESTING IN STOCKS IS RISKY AND THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF ANY STOCK OR INDEX DOES NOT GUARANTEE THEIR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. IF YOU INVEST BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON CHARTINSIGHT.COM, IT MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THIS WEBSITE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN INVESTMENT AND TRADING DECISIONS.</p>

        <p>This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of record, whether for breach of contract, tortuous behavior, negligence, or under any other cause of action.</p>

        <p>The Service may contain forward-looking statements about companies, including assessments about business prospects and future results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking projections or statements. The factors underlying all forecasts are dynamic and subject to change and therefore any forecast published or reproduced by chartinsight.com is relevant only to the date at which it is made.</p>

        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
        <p>User (and User&apos;s fund, if User is a representative of a fund) jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless ChartInsight LLC, and its agents, information providers and their agents, representatives, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, predecessors, successors and assigns, from and against any claim or demand, proceeding, damages, liabilities, losses or expenses, from claims made by a third party, arising from User&apos;s use of the ChartInsight information which constitutes a violation of the Terms of Service or an improper act or omission.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

        <p>Some parts of the Service are offered on a paid Subscription basis. Payment for a premium Subscription will be billed immediately upon completion of the payment form. Payments are non-refundable. We reserve the right, however, to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize ChartInsight LLC to charge the full amount of your subscription.</p>

        <p>Your subscription will initially be set to auto-renew. This can be changed by going into your Account settings page. At the end of each Yearly Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or ChartInsight cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your <a target="_blank" href="/following">account settings page</a> or by <a href="/about/contact" target="_blank">contacting customer support</a>.</p>

        <p>Should automatic billing fail for any reason, you will be notified and will be required to provide new payment information to continue your subscription.</p>

        <h3>Free Trial</h3>
        <p>ChartInsight may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (&quot;Free Trial&quot;). Free Trials are only for new users.</p>

        <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by ChartInsight until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>

        <p>At any time and without notice, ChartInsight reserves the right to (i) modify the terms of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

        <h3>Subscription Fees</h3>
        <p>Subscription fees shall be paid in full, and any levies, duties and/or taxes imposed by Customer&apos;s jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, sales tax or value added tax), shall be borne solely by Customer. Customer may not deduct any amounts from fees payable to ChartInsight.</p>

        <p>ChartInsight, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. ChartInsight will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

        <p>Your continued use of the Premium Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

        <h2>Service changes</h2>
        <p>ChartInsight reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time. ChartInsight may also impose limits on certain features and Service or restrict Subscriberâ€™s access to all or any parts of the Service without notice.</p>

        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>

All agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <p>Each account is only for use by one individual subscriber. Sharing account access with others without first obtaining our specific permission is a violation of this agreement, and will be cause for termination.</p>

The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.

        <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Washington, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 15 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
