            <h1>About ChartInsight</h1>
            <p>Individual investors cannot afford $2000/month for a Bloomberg terminal yet still need to make wise investment decisions. ChartInsight was founded in 2011 by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickennedys/">Eric Kennedy</a> out of frustration that only institutional investors had an easy way to compare fundamental company data (revenue, profit/loss, cash flow, debt, etc.) with a company&apos;s stock performance.</p>

            <p>In 2009, the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) started requiring companies to provide 10-Q and 10-K filings in XML format, enabling automated imports of company fundamental data. Combined with the lower cost of cloud hosting, this made it possible to provide free visualizations of company fundamentals. Comparing fundamentals to a company&apos;s stock price history allows investors to put market fluctuations in perspective with previous volatility and see when there is a margin of safety for investment.</p>
